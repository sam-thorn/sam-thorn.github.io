        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>
          What are three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a
          result of the Core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of the Core learning exercises during Foundations I
          gained a great deal of knowledge about my own approach to learning. I
          wasn’t particularly successful with regularly journalling reflections
          at the end of each day, however I found that being open to noticing
          how I was responding to certain situations was really valuable. I
          noticed, a lot, that I am great at comparing myself to others and
          feeling inadequate about my abilities. I found the Foundations Slack
          channel to be both a blessing and a curse in this regard. Whilst it is
          a hub of support and community I noticed that my approach to learning
          was likely to be affected by seeing others in my cohort well ahead of
          my own progress. I’d start to rush and diminish the quality of my own
          learning in order to produce more. It wasn’t until Sprint 4 that I
          became aware of this and started to forcibly try to focus on the
          quality of my own learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found that I was more confident being vulnerable with others than I
          had previously thought I was capable of. In the past this is something
          that I would definitely have shied away from. The combination of
          reflecting on difficult moments in written reflections, speaking to
          peers about challenges faced, and the supportive environment that EDA
          fosters have all helped me to feel more comfortable sharing when I’m
          struggling. I’m trying to change my mindset to view this as a strength
          as I think if I can be more open with others then that’s a positive
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many opportunities during Foundations to notice times where
          I would exhibit behaviours that would lean towards more of a fixed
          mindset. I think this is the mindset I have exhibited for much of my
          adult life. Whilst I have some prior knowledge of growth and fixed
          mindsets it has been rewarding to have an opportunity to really try
          and focus in on doing my best to try and cultivate some more growth
          mindset practices. I think I can now more clearly see a pathway to
          change to become someone with more growth mindset attributes than
          fixed.

        <h2>
          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In learning I think these things all help you to get the most out of
          your learning experience. They can guide and direct you, prompt
          reflection and help you to improve the effectiveness of your learning.
          Empathy and compassion are useful to help you to become a better
          colleague and more generally, better person. Programming is a
          challenging subject where a lot of time seems to be spent dealing with
          problems in the code. It can be easy to get into a negative headspace
          when you repeatedly come up against many small failures and so Core
          has been helpful for reframing failures as opportunities and will make
          us all in to better programmers.
        </p>

        <h2>What surprised me the most about Core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I found that I really engaged with the end of task and end of sprint
          reflections. I also got a lot out of the Listening and Looping
          exercises that we did during Core.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Core learning for me?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I found it difficult to continue practicing certain things, like
          mindfulness meditation and journalling. I’ve heard and read about how
          these two things, as an example, can have a significant positive
          effect on you but despite this I haven’t yet been able to keep up the
          practice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          Why do I think EDA, a programming school, is spending so much time
          focusing on Core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It’s about creating better people, more employable people who are more
          likely to fit into a company culture once this course concludes and we
          set about interviewing for jobs. Both technical programming abilities
          and the skills taught in Core are helping to create well-rounded
          candidates for companies out there in the market.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          Does the time I spent studying Core learning feel like a waste of
          time? Would it have been better to spend that time practicing
          programming instead?
        </h2>
        <p>Not at all, I think it has helped to improve my programming.</p>
