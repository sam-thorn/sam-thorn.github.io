        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>How Does an Understanding of Neuroplasticity Benefit You?</h2>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain’s capacity to continue to adapt or change
          over time by creating new neurone and building new networks. Neural
          activities that are used often become strongly linked in the brain and
          those that aren’t are forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists previously believed that the brain stopped growing after
          adolescence but more recent research has showed that the brain is able
          to continue growing and changing throughout the human lifespan. This
          means that it is possible to change dysfunctional patterns of thinking
          and behaving and to develop new mindsets, new skills, and new
          abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all of this in mind it is empowering when approaching a new topic
          that you would like to learn about, or to try and get better at
          something that you have previously considered difficult. By creating
          the right conditions for learning, your brain is able to grow and
          adapt to this stimulus. Even just understanding how the brain works in
          this way is motivating for anyone who wants to make a positive change
          in their life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Engaging With Neuroplasticity For Your Own Benefit</h2>
        <p>
          Neural pathways are strengthened by repeatedly engaging the neurons
          required for a particular mental task. This could be in order to
          perform a physical action or to imagine performing the same action,
          the same neural pathways are engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities that help to promote the strengthening of your synaptic
          connectivity are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reflection</li>
          <li>Intentional practice</li>
          <li>Meditation</li>
          <li>Mindfulness</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What Are Some Ways You Can Increase Your Neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the ways that you are able to increase your neuroplasticity
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reflection - Think about it in a critical but positive fashion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do - Repeat the action. This can either be physically or by
            imagining it. Over time, physical repetition has a greater benefit
            so it is important to not only imagine the action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice - Practice the thing in a variety of different ways and
            settings if possible. A positive mental environment is key to better
            engage your brain.
          </li>
          <li>Play - Make it fun!</li>
          <li>
            Belief - If you can believe that you can increase your ability to
            learn, you are more likely to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Motivation - If you really want to achieve a goal, or grow in line
            with your values or life purpose, you are more likely to create a
            better focus environment for learning and retaining new information
            - because it is important to you.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Link to a Useful Resource</h2>
        <p>
          I found the 10 Fundamentals of neuroplasticity described in Debbie
          Hampton’s article interesting! I hadn’t previously considered that
          motivation helps to improve the brain’s ability to learn or that brain
          plasticity is a two-way street where negative changes are as easy to
          make as positive ones.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is a theory centred around the belief that intelligence
          and learning are not fixed, but can be developed and improved. Someone
          with a growth mindset will have a positive attitude towards learning
          and their ability to progress and achieve. This person is also more
          likely to rise to challenges and to learn from mistakes rather than
          feeling stressed and defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these things in mind, and if you are able to practice and show to
          yourself that you can improve, you are setting yourself up with a much
          higher chance of succeeding at your chosen goal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What Did I Discover About Myself in This Exploration?</h2>
        <p>
          I think in the past I have definitely exhibited fixed mindset
          behaviours and so I am encouraged to try to turn this around to get
          the most out of learning and take a growth mindset approach into other
          aspects of life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>How I Will Integrate a Growth Mindset Into My Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Since learning about the growth mindset I have changed how I talk
          about my abilities. I’ll often intentionally use the word “yet” when
          talking about something I’m not currently skilled at. As though I’m
          not yet good at that thing but there’s no reason I couldn’t be if I
          chose to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will try my best to practice framing challenges as opportunities for
          growth and improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>
          How Will These New Learnings Influence My Learning Plan and Strategy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have created a daily plan to practice previously covered content and
          intentionally target things I found difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will try to form habits out of meditation, journalling, and goal
          setting and reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will try to be mindful of my mental approach to challenges in order
          to frame these in a positive fashion, believing that I am capable of
          learning anything if I apply myself.
