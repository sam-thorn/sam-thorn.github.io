                        <h2>My long term goal / career pathway ambitions:</h2>
                            <p>In the long term I am interested in developing my skills in full stack web development with more of a focus on front-end. 
                            I’d like to work in an innovative environment around creative people.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>What non-technical human skills would I like to develop whilst at EDA?</h2>
                            <p>During the EDA bootcamp I'd like to see myself develop:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My empathy skills</li>
                            <li>My confidence in general; that I can do new and hard things.</li>
                            <li>Not being afraid to ask a question for worry that I’ll look bad in front of my peers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Commitment to learning - how will I manage my workload</h2>
                            <p>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry representatives:</p>
                                <p>Myself</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I will commit to giving my best effort to try to succeed in this course.</li>
                                    <li>I will try to plan out my week’s workload so that I understand how much I need to do each day in order to manage my stress levels.</li>
                                    <li>I will try to manage my mental health in order to stay productive and positive.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>I will always be available to help with any question or problem. Happy to be a sounding board even if I don’t know the answer.</li>
                                    <li>I will try to be a friendly and positive peer.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>I will try myself to find the solution to a problem before asking a question, and I’ll try my best to ask a narrow question that gets to the point of the problem.</li>
                                    <li>I recognise that the facilitators have their own workload to manage so I will be respectful of their time commitments.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>

                                    <li>I will show respect  and to those giving their time outside of work to come and speak with us (or whatever their involvement might be).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>

                                <li>I will try to reach out to someone else to talk.</li>
                                <li>I will try to drink water and take little breaks away from the screen.</li>
                                <li>Get as much sleep as possible</li>
                                <li>Continue to exercise regularly</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>If I come across a problem, I will first try to find the answer myself; if I can’t I will reach out to my peers (on Slack or in person) or a facilitator.</li>
                                <li>I will try my best to not spend too long getting bogged down on a problem.</li>
                                <li>I will remember that others are working to their own schedule and may not be available to speak with me immediately. I need to plan for this in advance.</li>
                            </ul>
                                <br>

                                <li>I would like the facilitators to be available for ad hoc chats when their schedule allows.</li>
                                <li>I would appreciate if they tried their best not to get frustrated by ill informed questions (as long as its apparent I’ve tried to research the problem).</li>
                                
                            </ul>

                                <li>Twice a week I will try to get to a 6pm gym class.</li>
                                <li>On Thursday nights around 6pm I cook dinner for my flatmates. I usually go to the supermarket the same day around 12pm.</li>
